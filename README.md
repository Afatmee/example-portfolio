## Research Experience
**Research Analyst @ Research and Development Solutions (_June 2023 - August 2024_)**
*Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation: Global Burden of Disease*
- Utilized spatial mapping techniques to identify clusters of operational zero-dose and incomplete measles immunization in Pakistan, exploring associations with migration patterns.

- Assessed the incidence of 'zero-dose' children aged 12-23 months in Pakistan, incorporating maternal healthcare access during the prenatal period, and social determinants of health identifying clustering patterns to pinpoint hot spots for equity analysis.

- Reviewed evaluation toolkit including quantitative tools on Third-party evaluation of health facility assessment for immunization services run by the Aga Khan University and BMGF.
- Refined the analytical framework to examine the impact of antenatal care (ANC) and family planning (FP) indicators on infant, neonatal, and perinatal mortality rates in Pakistan, with enhancements to the research write-up.
- Analyzed 15-year longitudinal patient visitation data from National surveys to gauge quantum of healthcare facility utilization at provincial level.

  *Family Planning and Reproductive Health* 
- Prepared a concept note to identify unaddressed areas within Pakistan’s contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) landscape that could be served by private stakeholders, specifically DKT.
- Determined the utilization of social franchising specifically DKT and MSS in Family Planning Services in Pakistan, comparing the periods before and during the COVID19 pandemic.
